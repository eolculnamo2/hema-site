I have asked questions to people their perceptions of how British people fight and all they say is , “brawling.” However, by all my experience in MARE(Martial Arts of Renaissance Europe, I’ve been studying MARE for almost 12 years)and snooping around into later eras of martial arts that I cannot help but to refute that this is further from the truth.",

Though it is important to train in all aspects, armed combat (especially with the long sword either single edged or double edged) should be the focus of all martial arts training.",
